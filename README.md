# Kerinci Project

This is a *hobby* project aiming to provide Vulkan SDK for Java using FFM.
For window managemant GLFW is used and for matrice/vector calculation GLM.

## Requirements

Vulkan (currently 1.3.239.0) must be installed.

Cmake must be installed.

Python3 must be installed.

Jextract must be installed.

## Structure

There are three modules:
* **native-lib-plugin**: provides maven plugin to compile the native dll using CMake and generate a java handler for this dll using Jextract.
* **kerinci-internal**: Java Api to providing GLFW and Vulkan functions. This api uses the plugin described above and acts as a proxy for the underlying FFM calls generated by Jextract. The dll is currently generated by `api.py` until a better approach is found.
* **kerinci-example**: running example, showing how to use the Java Api implemented in the internal module
